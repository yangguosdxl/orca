// Why: relative timestamps drift once mounted. A 30s tick keeps the "Xm
// ago" labels honest without burning a render every second.
//
// Hoisted to a shared hook so container components (e.g.
// WorktreeCardAgents) can own a single tick and thread `now` down to every
// DashboardAgentRow. Previously each row instantiated its own interval,
// which meant N timers firing at staggered mount times for N rows on
// screen — turning one logical tick into N independent React commits.
