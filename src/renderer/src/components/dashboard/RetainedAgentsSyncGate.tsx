// Why: isolate the retention subscriptions in a leaf component that renders
// null, so the high-churn slices read by useDashboardData
// (agentStatusByPaneKey + agentStatusEpoch, which tick at PTY event frequency)
// do not re-render the entire App tree. Retention must still run at the App
// level — if it only ran when a single card was mounted, "done" agents would
// vanish from the inline agents list any time the user scrolled that card
// out of view.
//
// The hooks inside still early-return when the experimentalAgentDashboard
// setting is off, so this gate is cheap when the feature is disabled.
