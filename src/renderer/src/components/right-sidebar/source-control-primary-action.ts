// Why: this module owns the pure state-machine logic for the Source Control
// primary action (split button). Keeping the logic outside the React component
// makes it straightforward to unit-test each row of the priority table without
// spinning up a renderer.

// Why: the primary button collapses to one-label-per-action. Compound
// kinds ('commit_push', 'commit_sync', 'commit_publish') live in
// DropdownActionKind only — never on the primary — so they are not part
// of this union. Narrowing the type here is load-bearing: it lets
// `handlePrimaryClick` switch exhaustively over only the kinds the
// primary can actually emit, and it kills the compound-commit branch in
// the isRemoteOperationActive tooltip below at compile time.

// triggered, so the primary button can mirror that label/spinner instead of
// claiming a stale or unrelated operation is running. 'fetch' is included
// because Fetch participates in the busy flag, but it is intentionally NOT
// in PrimaryActionKind — Fetch is dropdown-only, so when fetch is in flight
// the primary keeps its natural label and CommitArea suppresses the spinner.

/**
 * Resolve the primary split-button action.

 * Priority order mirrors the design-doc state machine:
 *   1. In-flight commit locks the primary to a disabled "Commit".
 *   2. In-flight remote operation keeps the current label but disables it.
 *   3. Unresolved conflicts block the commit path entirely.
 *   4. Has staged files + message → plain "Commit" (compound flows live in
 *      the dropdown; after the commit lands, step 6 rotates the primary to
 *      the appropriate single remote action).
 *   5. Has staged files + no message → disabled "Commit" with a reason.
 *   6. Clean tree → adaptive remote action (or disabled "Commit" no-op).
 *
 * An undefined upstream status means fetchUpstreamStatus has not resolved
 * yet for this worktree. We return a disabled Commit so the button has a
 * stable frame until the real status lands — otherwise it would flash
 * through "Publish Branch" on every worktree switch.
