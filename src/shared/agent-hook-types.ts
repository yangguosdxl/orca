// Why: shared agent-hook IPC payload shapes and the managed-script protocol
// version constant. Consumed by both the main-process hook server (src/main/
// agent-hooks/server.ts) and each per-agent hook service (claude/codex/
// gemini/cursor/hook-service.ts). Lives in `shared/` to keep a single
// source of truth for the version string and status contract.

export type AgentHookTarget = 'claude' | 'codex' | 'gemini' | 'cursor'

export type AgentHookInstallState = 'installed' | 'not_installed' | 'partial' | 'error'

export type AgentHookInstallStatus = {

}

// Why: bumped whenever the managed script's request shape changes. The
// receiver logs a warning when it sees a request from a different version so a
// stale script installed by an older app build is diagnosable instead of
// silently producing partial payloads. Still at v1 because the endpoint-file
// rollout is additive — pre-endpoint-file scripts still post the same JSON
// body shape, and no in-wild v1 script exists that a future v2 receiver would
// need to distinguish from: Claude/Codex/Gemini install is gated behind the
// experimentalAgentDashboard setting (off by default, so no shipped fleet),
// and Cursor's managed script is rewritten on every install() call so there
// is no durable on-disk v1 script to inherit. Reserve the next bump for a
// real wire change.
