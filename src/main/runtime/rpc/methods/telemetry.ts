// CLI-side telemetry funnels through this RPC method into main's `track()`.
// The CLI process never talks to PostHog directly — there is one write key,
// one consent gate, one validator, one wire identity (install_id, app_version,
// session_id, …) attached on the main side. This file is the narrow boundary
// where a CLI-originated event becomes a typed `track()` call.
//
// Threat model: the CLI is a separate process and the RPC socket is
// auth-token gated, but we still narrow the incoming `name` to a CLI subset
// (`isCliEventName`). A buggy or compromised CLI must not be able to spoof
// `agent_started` / `telemetry_opted_in` / etc. by posting them through this
// channel — those are main-owned events.
//
// Not in `src/main/ipc/telemetry.ts`: that file is renderer-only (Electron
// `ipcMain.handle()`). The CLI talks to main over the UNIX-socket / named-
// pipe runtime RPC dispatcher, not Electron IPC.
