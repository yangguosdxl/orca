/**
 * Resolve the current working directory of a local process by pid.
 *
 * Why duplicated from `src/relay/pty-shell-utils.ts`: the relay and Electron
 * main process have separate build graphs, and cross-importing across them
 * is not a pattern used in this repo. The function is short and pure, and
 * the duplication is cheaper than reshaping both bundle graphs.
 *
 * Tries `/proc/<pid>/cwd` on Linux, falls back to `lsof -d cwd` on macOS.
 * Returns `''` when neither works (including Windows, where `/proc` is
 * absent and `lsof` is not native).
 *
 * Results are coalesced and briefly cached per-pid: rapid repeat calls
 * (e.g. chained Cmd+D on macOS) reuse a single `lsof` child rather than
 * stacking concurrent subprocesses whose results the caller may discard
 * after its own timeout.
